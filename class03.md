its matter because I will deal with many lists to create many elements

## Questions1
1. **What does .map() return?**
    - it returns new array with new values or same values whatever the purpose of use it.
2. **If I want to loop through an array and display each value in JSX, how do I do that in React?**

### Spread operators answers
-What is the spread operator?
 Spreading an array out into a functionâ€™s arguments.

-List 4 things that the spread operator can do.
adding items to arrays, combining arrays or objects, Using Math functions and Adding an item to a list

-Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two arrays.
  var arr1 = [1,2,3];
      var arr2 = [4,5,6];
      var merged = [...arr1, ...arr2];

-Give an example of using the spread operator to add a new item to an array.
var oldArray = [{'value': '1', 'label': 'a'}, {'value': '2', 'label': 'b'}]
var newObj = {'value': 'all', 'label': 'all'}
var result = [newObj, ...oldArray]

-Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two objects into one.

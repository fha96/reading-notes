# Functional Programming Concepts
- What is functional programming?

 Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data — Wikipedia

- What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?

It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic)
It does not cause any observable side effects

- What are the benefits of a pure function?
It is easier to test, The code’s definitely easier to test. We don’t need to mock anything

- What is immutability?

state cannot change after it’s created. If you want to change an immutable object, you can’t. Instead, you create a new object with the new value.
What is Referential transparency?

it can be replaced with its corresponding value (and vice-versa) without changing the program’s behavior pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency

# Node Modules

-What is a module?
simple or complex functionality organized in single or multiple JavaScript files which can be reused throughout the Node

-What does the word ‘require’ do?
used to load and cache JavaScript modules

-How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?
module.exports = { your function };

-What do we have to do to make a module available?
require(“your file path”);

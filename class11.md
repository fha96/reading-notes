# SQL VS NoSQL comparison
| SQL | NoSQL |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Relational Databases | non-relational or distributed |
| Data represent as number of rows | collection of key-value pair |
| predefined schema whereas | NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data |
| vertically scalable | horizontally scalable |
| SQL databases are scaled by increasing the horse-power of the hardware | NoSQL databases are scaled by increasing the databases servers in the pool of resources to reduce the load. |
| structured query language defining and manipulating the data | structured query language defining and manipulating the data |
| examples:MySql, Oracle, Sqlite | examples: MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb |
